## Overview

### Challenges

I've tried to build the project with DRY code pattern. The reusable components and functionality is little bit tricky. Which took more times to maintain the DRY code pattern. Also the responsiveness was little bit tricky.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- ES6
- React JS
- JSX
- Context API
- Module CSS
- Fontawesome

### What I learned

In real life projects, the logics are more critical and challenging. I faced the real life challenges. It is simple to think, but tough to build the logic to perform perfectly. And I need to give more time in problem solving.

## Acknowledgments

I didn't take help from others. Even I didn't use any third party CSS framework or styling library to style. Not even for the functionality. Without React JS, I didn't use any third party library or frameworks to complete the task easily and perfectly.
